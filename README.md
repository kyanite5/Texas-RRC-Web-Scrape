# Texas RRC Web Scraping 

A methodology for automating scraping the Texas Railroad Commission's website for saltwater disposal wells.

I was given a technical assessment as part of an interview for a geoscience analyst. The assignment specifically requested to find all saltwater disposal wells in District 10 in Texas. The attached code is is a way to automate the process.

Any comments or suggestions on how to improve this process is greatly appreciated!
